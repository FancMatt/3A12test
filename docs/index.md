# This is my new markdown file in a folder called docs!
  Use slashes to designate folder.

## Learning to use markdown:

**This text is bold**
  
_This text is italicised_
  
~~This text is crossed out~~
  
  This is a list:
  - First item
  - ***Second item***
  - **The _THIRD_ item**

  You can also use HTML code to make it look really cool, above this line are line breaks!
  
  > This is a quote of some text, who knows where it is from :D
